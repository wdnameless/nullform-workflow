# tasteskill: Anti-Slop Frontend Skill

> Landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. Not dashboards, not data tables, not multi-step product UI.
> Every rule below is **contextual**. None of it fires automatically. First read the brief, then pull only what fits.

---

## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography. For redesigns, these are starting material, not optional input (see Section 11).
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

Example reads:
- *"Reading this as: B2B SaaS landing for technical buyers, with a Linear-style minimalist language, leaning toward Tailwind utilities + Geist + restrained motion."*
- *"Reading this as: solo designer portfolio for hiring managers, with an editorial / kinetic-type language, leaning toward native CSS + scroll-driven animation + custom typography."*
- *"Reading this as: redesign of a public-sector service site, with a trust-first language, leaning toward GOV.UK Frontend or USWDS."*

### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, ask one question, do not guess
Ask exactly **one** clarifying question - never a multi-question dump - and only when the design read genuinely diverges. Example: *"Should this feel closer to Linear-clean or Awwwards-experimental?"*

If you can confidently infer from context, **do not ask**. Just declare the design read and proceed.

### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900. These are the LLM defaults. Reach past them deliberately based on the design read.

---

## 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

After the design read, set three dials. Every layout, motion, and density decision below is gated by these.

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`. Use these unless the design read overrides them. Do not ask the user to edit this file - overrides happen conversationally.

### 1.A Dial Inference (design read → dial values)
| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental / agency" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / accessibility-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| "redesign - preserve" | match existing | +1 | match existing |
| "redesign - overhaul" | +2 | +2 | match existing |

### 1.B Use-Case Presets
| Use case | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing (SaaS, mainstream) | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| Landing (Agency / creative) | 9 | 8 | 3 |
| Landing (Premium consumer) | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Designer / studio) | 8 | 7 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Developer) | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| Editorial / Blog | 6 | 4 | 3 |
| Public-sector service | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Redesign - preserve | match | match+1 | match |
| Redesign - overhaul | +2 | +2 | match |

### 1.C How the Dials Drive Output
Use these (or user-overridden values) as global variables. Cross-references throughout this document refer to these exact variable names - never invent aliases like `LAYOUT_VARIANCE` or `ANIM_LEVEL`.

---

## 2. BRIEF → DESIGN SYSTEM MAP

Once you have the design read (Section 0) and dials (Section 1), pick the right foundation. Do not invent CSS for things that have an official package. Do not pretend an aesthetic trend is an official system.

### 2.A When to reach for a real design system (use official packages)
| Brief reads as… | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft / enterprise SaaS / dashboards | `@fluentui/react-components` or `@fluentui/web-components` | Official Fluent UI, Microsoft tokens, accessibility done |
| Google-ish UI, Material-flavored product | `@material/web` + Material 3 tokens | Official, theme-able via Material Theming |
| IBM-style B2B / enterprise analytics | `@carbon/react` + `@carbon/styles` | Official Carbon, mature data-density patterns |
| Shopify app surfaces | `polaris.js` web components / Polaris React | Required for Shopify admin UI |
| Atlassian / Jira-style product | `@atlaskit/*` + `@atlaskit/tokens` | Official Atlassian DS |
| GitHub-style devtool / community page | `@primer/css` or `@primer/react-brand` | Official Primer; Brand variant for marketing |
| Public-sector UK service | `govuk-frontend` | Legally / regulatorily expected |
| US public-sector / trust-first | `uswds` | Same |
| Fast local-business / agency MVP | Bootstrap 5.3 | Boring, fast, works |
| Modern accessible React foundation | `@radix-ui/themes` | Primitives + polished theme |
| Modern SaaS where you own the components | shadcn/ui (`npx shadcn@latest add ...`) | You own the code, easy to customise; never ship default state |
| Tailwind-based modern SaaS / AI marketing | Tailwind v4 utilities + `dark:` variant | Default for indie + small team builds |

**Honesty rule:** if the brief reads as one of the systems above, install and use the **official** package. Do not recreate its CSS by hand. Do not import a system's tokens but then override 90% of them.

**One system per project.** Do not mix Fluent React with Carbon in the same tree. Do not import shadcn/ui components into a Material 3 app.

### 2.B When the brief is an aesthetic, not a system
For these directions, there is **no single official package**. Build with native CSS + Tailwind + a maintained component library. Be honest in code comments about what is borrowed inspiration vs. official material.

| Aesthetic | Honest implementation |
|---|---|
| Glassmorphism / "frosted glass" | `backdrop-filter`, layered borders, highlight overlays. Provide solid-fill fallback for `prefers-reduced-transparency`. |
| Bento (Apple-style tile grids) | CSS Grid with mixed cell sizes. No single library owns this. |
| Brutalism | Native CSS, monospace, raw borders. No library. |
| Editorial / magazine | Serif type, asymmetric grid, generous whitespace. No library. |
| Dark tech / hacker | Mono + accent neon, terminal motifs. No library. |
| Aurora / mesh gradients | SVG or layered radial gradients. No library. |
| Kinetic typography | Native CSS animations, scroll-driven animations, GSAP for hijacks. No library. |
| **Apple Liquid Glass** | Apple documents this for Apple platforms only. **There is no official `liquid-glass.css`.** Web implementations are approximations using `backdrop-filter` + layered borders + highlights. Label clearly as approximation. |

---

## 3. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS

Unless the design read picks a real design system (Section 2.A), these are the defaults:

### 3.A Stack
* **Framework:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (RSC).
  * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
  * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** Any component using Motion, scroll listeners, or pointer physics MUST be an isolated leaf with `'use client'` at the top. Server Components render static layouts only.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind v4** (default). Tailwind v3 only if the existing project demands it.
  * For v4: do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **Animation:** **Motion** (the library formerly known as Framer Motion). Import from `motion/react` (`import { motion } from "motion/react"`). The `framer-motion` package still works as a legacy alias - prefer `motion/react` in new code.
* **Fonts:** Always use `next/font` (Next.js) or self-host with `@font-face` + `font-display: swap`. Never link Google Fonts via `<link>` in production.

### 3.B State
* Local `useState` / `useReducer` for isolated UI.
* Global state ONLY for deep prop-drilling avoidance - Zustand, Jotai, or React context.
* **NEVER** use `useState` to track continuous values driven by user input (mouse position, scroll progress, pointer physics, magnetic hover). Use Motion's `useMotionValue` / `useTransform` / `useScroll`. `useState` re-renders the React tree on every change and collapses on mobile.

### 3.C Icons
* **Allowed libraries (priority order):** `@phosphor-icons/react`, `hugeicons-react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`, `@tabler/icons-react`.
* **Discouraged:** `lucide-react`. Acceptable only when the user explicitly asks for it or the project already depends on it.
* **NEVER hand-roll SVG icons.** If a glyph is missing, install a second library or compose from primitives - do not draw icon paths from scratch.
* **One family per project.** Do not mix Phosphor with Lucide in the same component tree.
* **Standardize `strokeWidth` globally** (e.g. `1.5` or `2.0`).

### 3.D Emoji Policy
Discouraged by default in code, markup, and visible text. Replace symbols with icon-library glyphs. **Override:** allow emojis only when the user explicitly asks for a playful / chat-style / social-native vibe - and even then use them sparingly with intent.

### 3.E Responsiveness & Layout Mechanics
* Standardize breakpoints (`sm 640`, `md 768`, `lg 1024`, `xl 1280`, `2xl 1536`).
* Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
* **Viewport Stability:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent layout jumping on mobile (iOS Safari address bar).
* **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`).

### 3.F Dependency Verification (mandatory)
Before importing ANY 3rd-party library, check `package.json`. If the package is missing, output the install command first. **Never** assume a library exists.

---

## 4. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)

LLMs default to clichés. Override these defaults proactively. Each rule has a context-aware override path.

For complete directive specifications, see [references/directives-and-ai-tells.md](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md):
- [4.1 Typography](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#41-typography): Display/body scales, Inter discouragement, and strict serif discipline (no arbitrary serif default; no Fraunces/Instrument_Serif; italic descender clearance).
- [4.2 Color Calibration](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#42-color-calibration): 1 accent max, Lila rule (no AI purple glows), color consistency lock, and premium-consumer beige/brass palette ban.
- [4.3 Layout Diversification](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#43-layout-diversification): Anti-center bias on variance > 4, split screen, asymmetric white-space.
- [4.4 Materiality, Shadows, Cards](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#44-materiality-shadows-cards): Cards only for elevation, tinted shadows, single corner-radius scale.
- [4.5 Interactive UI States](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#45-interactive-ui-states): Skeletal loaders, tactile push, button/form contrast checks, and no wrapped or duplicate-intent CTAs.
- [4.6 Data & Form Patterns](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#46-data--form-patterns): Labels above inputs, no placeholder-as-label.
- [4.7 Layout Discipline](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#47-layout-discipline-hard-rules-failing-any-of-these-is-shipping-broken-work): Hero viewport fit (20 words subtext max), max 4 text elements, nav on one line (<=80px), bento cell-count rule, max 1 eyebrow per 3 sections, zigzag alternation cap.
- [4.8 Image & Visual Asset Strategy](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#48-image--visual-asset-strategy): Real or generated assets, Simple Icons logos, div-based fake screenshot ban.
- [4.9 Content Density](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#49-content-density): Cut ruthlessly, spec sheet alternatives, copy self-audit, no fake-precise numbers.
- [4.10 Quotes & Testimonials](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#410-quotes--testimonials): 3 lines max quotes, single theme across the whole page.
- [4.11 Page Theme Lock](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#411-page-theme-lock-light--dark-mode-consistency): Unified page theme, sections do not invert mid-scroll.

---

## 5. CONTEXT-AWARE PROACTIVITY

These are tools, not defaults. Use them when the design read calls for them. **None of these fire automatically.**

For full implementation details, skeletons, and rules, see [references/proactivity-and-redesign.md](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md):
- [5.A Sticky-Stack Canonical Skeleton](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#5a-sticky-stack---canonical-skeleton): Real GSAP ScrollTrigger card stack pinning at viewport top (`start: "top top"`).
- [5.B Horizontal-Pan Canonical Skeleton](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#5b-horizontal-pan---canonical-skeleton): Vertical scroll to horizontal travel scrub with pinned wrapper.
- [5.C Scroll-Reveal Stagger](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#5c-scroll-reveal-stagger---canonical-skeleton-lighter-alternative): Lightweight Motion `whileInView` for sequential entry without ScrollTrigger.
- [5.D Forbidden Animation Patterns](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#5d-forbidden-animation-patterns): Hard ban on raw `window.addEventListener("scroll")`, unbatched scroll state, and mixing Motion with GSAP in one tree.

---

## 6. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY GUARDRAILS

### 6.A Hardware Acceleration
* Animate ONLY `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`.
* Use `will-change: transform` sparingly - only on elements that will actually animate.

### 6.B Reduced Motion (mandatory)
* **Any motion above `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3` MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** This is non-negotiable.
* In Motion: wrap with `useReducedMotion()` and degrade to static.
* In CSS: gate animations behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide an override block under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables.
* Infinite loops, parallax, scroll-hijack, and magnetic physics MUST collapse to static / instant under reduced motion.

### 6.C Dark Mode (mandatory for any consumer-facing page)
* Design for **both modes from the start**. Never ship light-only or dark-only without explicit user instruction.
* Use Tailwind `dark:` variant OR CSS variables for tokens. Pick one strategy per project.
* **Do not prescribe specific dark-mode colors here.** The brief decides. Maintain visual hierarchy, brand identity, and WCAG AA contrast (AAA for body) across both modes.
* Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Default to system preference unless the brand insists on one mode.

### 6.D Core Web Vitals Targets
* **LCP** < 2.5s. Hero image must be `next/image priority` or preloaded.
* **INP** < 200ms. Heavy work off main thread.
* **CLS** < 0.1. Reserve space for images, fonts, embeds.
* Run Lighthouse before declaring a page done.

### 6.E DOM Cost
* Apply grain / noise filters EXCLUSIVELY to fixed, `pointer-events-none` pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-[60] pointer-events-none`). NEVER on scrolling containers - continuous GPU repaints destroy mobile FPS.
* Be aware of bundle size. Motion is not tiny. Three.js is large. Lazy-load anything that's not above-the-fold.

### 6.F Z-Index Restraint
NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10`. Use z-index strictly for systemic layer contexts (sticky navbars, modals, overlays, grain). Document the z-index scale in a project constants file.

---

## 7. DIAL DEFINITIONS (Technical Reference)

### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Symmetrical CSS Grid (12-col, equal fr-units), equal paddings, centered alignment.
* **4-7 (Offset):** `margin-top: -2rem` overlaps, varied image aspect ratios (4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (`grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, asymmetric layouts above `md:` MUST collapse to strict single-column (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px`.

### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only. `prefers-reduced-motion` is the default mode anyway.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus on `transform` and `opacity`.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, scroll-driven animation (CSS `animation-timeline` or GSAP ScrollTrigger). Use Motion hooks. **NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - it is a hard ban, not a "prefer-not." See Section 5.D for the allowed alternatives.

### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps (`py-32` to `py-48`). Expensive, clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App):** Standard web app spacing (`py-16` to `py-24`).
* **8-10 (Cockpit):** Tight paddings. No card boxes; 1px lines separate data. Mandatory: `font-mono` for all numbers.

---

## 8. DARK MODE PROTOCOL

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

### 8.A Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

### 8.B Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **No pure `#000000` and no pure `#ffffff`** - use off-black (zinc-950, near-black warm gray) and off-white. Pure values kill depth.

### 8.C Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.
### 8.D Test in Both Modes Before Finishing
Open the page in both modes during development. Do not ship a page you've only seen in one mode.

---

## 9. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)

Avoid these signatures unless the brief explicitly asks for them.

For complete catalog of forbidden AI tells, see [references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9-ai-tells-forbidden-patterns](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9-ai-tells-forbidden-patterns):
- [9.A Visual & CSS](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9a-visual--css): No neon/outer glows, no pure black `#000000`, no oversaturated accents, no custom cursors.
- [9.B Typography](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9b-typography): Avoid default Inter, no screaming oversized H1s, serif constraints.
- [9.C Layout & Spacing](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9c-layout--spacing): No generic 3-column equal feature cards.
- [9.D Content & Data](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9d-content--data-jane-doe-effect): No generic names ("Jane Doe"), no egg avatars, no filler verbs ("Elevate", "Revolutionize").
- [9.E External Resources & Components](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9e-external-resources--components): No hand-rolled SVG icons/illustrations as defaults, no div-based fake screenshots.
- [9.F Production-Test Tells](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9f-production-test-tells-banned-outright): No version labels in hero, no section-number eyebrows (`001 · Capabilities`), middle-dot rationed (max 1/line), no photo-credit captions as decoration.
- [9.G Non-Negotiable Em-Dash Ban](references/directives-and-ai-tells.md#9g-em-dash-ban-the-single-most-violated-tell): Em-dash (`—`) is completely banned in headlines, body copy, eyebrows, quotes, and buttons. Use regular hyphen (`-`).

---

## 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY (Pattern Names the Agent Should Know)

This is a vocabulary, not a library. The agent should KNOW these pattern names to communicate about them, design with them in mind, and reach for them when the design read calls for them. Implementations and code sketches live in the Block Library (Section 12), which is populated iteratively.

For the full catalog of patterns (Hero Paradigms, Navigation & Menus, Layout & Grids, Cards & Containers, Scroll Animations, Galleries & Media, Typography & Text, Micro-Interactions), see [references/vocabulary-and-block-library.md](references/vocabulary-and-block-library.md).

---

## 11. REDESIGN PROTOCOL

This skill handles greenfield builds AND redesigns. Misclassifying the mode is the single biggest source of bad redesign output.

For full audit procedures and decision trees, see [references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11-redesign-protocol](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11-redesign-protocol):
- [11.A Detect the Mode](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11a-detect-the-mode-first-action): Classify as Greenfield, Redesign - Preserve, or Redesign - Overhaul.
- [11.B Audit Before Touching](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11b-audit-before-touching): Audit brand tokens, IA, content blocks, patterns to preserve/retire, and SEO baseline.
- [11.C Preservation Rules](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11c-preservation-rules): Keep IA stable, extract existing brand colors (Lila override), preserve copy voice and analytics hooks.
- [11.D Modernisation Levers](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11d-modernisation-levers-priority-order): Typography refresh -> Spacing -> Color -> Motion -> Hero recomposition.
- [11.F What Never Changes Silently](references/proactivity-and-redesign.md#11f-what-never-changes-silently): Never modify URLs, form field names, logos, or legal copy without explicit approval.

---

## 12. THE BLOCK LIBRARY (Contract - Implementations Land Here Iteratively)

The Reference Vocabulary (Section 10) names patterns. The Block Library implements them with real props, real motion specs, and real code sketches.

For complete block library location, required frontmatter, required body sections, and discipline rules, see [references/vocabulary-and-block-library.md#12-the-block-library-contract---implementations-land-here-iteratively](references/vocabulary-and-block-library.md#12-the-block-library-contract---implementations-land-here-iteratively).

---

## 13. OUT OF SCOPE

This skill is NOT for:
* Dashboards / dense product UI / admin panels (use Fluent, Carbon, Atlassian, or Polaris from Section 2.A).
* Data tables (use TanStack Table or AG Grid).
* Multi-step forms / wizards (use Form-specific patterns; this skill won't make them better).
* Code editors (use Monaco / CodeMirror with their official skinning).
* Native mobile (use Apple HIG / Material directly).
* Realtime collab UIs (presence, cursors, OT-aware - different problem class).

If the brief is one of the above, **say so explicitly**, point to the right tool, and only apply this skill's marketing-page / about-page / landing-page parts to the surfaces where they apply.

## 14. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

Run this matrix before outputting code. This is the last filter.

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. Run every box. If any box fails, the output is not done.**

- [ ] **Brief inference** declared (Section 0.B one-liner)?
- [ ] **Dial values** explicit and reasoned from the brief, not silently using baseline?
- [ ] **Design system** chosen from Section 2 if applicable, or aesthetic labeled honestly?
- [ ] **Redesign mode** detected and audit performed (if applicable, Section 11)?
- [ ] **ZERO em-dashes (`—`) anywhere on the page.** Headlines, eyebrows, pills, body, quotes, attribution, captions, buttons, alt text. Zero. (Section 9.G - non-negotiable.)
- [ ] **Page Theme Lock**: ONE theme (light, dark, or auto) for the whole page. No section flips to inverted mode mid-page (Section 4.11)?
- [ ] **Color Consistency Lock**: one accent color used identically across all sections (Section 4.2)?
- [ ] **Shape Consistency Lock**: one corner-radius system applied consistently (Section 4.4)?
- [ ] **Button Contrast Check**: every CTA text is readable against its background (no white-on-white, WCAG AA 4.5:1)?
- [ ] **CTA Button Wrap**: no CTA label wraps to 2+ lines at desktop?
- [ ] **Form Contrast Check**: form inputs, placeholders, focus rings, labels all pass WCAG AA against the section background?
- [ ] **Serif discipline**: if a serif is used, it is NOT Fraunces or Instrument_Serif (or it is, with explicit brand justification)? Different serif from your previous project?
- [ ] **Premium-consumer palette check**: if the brief is premium-consumer (cookware / wellness / artisan / luxury), the palette is NOT the AI-default beige+brass+oxblood+espresso family? Different family from your previous premium-consumer project?
- [ ] **Italic descender clearance**: every italic word with `y g j p q` has `leading-[1.1]` min + `pb-1` reserve?
- [ ] **Hero fits the viewport**: headline ≤ 2 lines, subtext ≤ 20 words AND ≤ 4 lines, CTA visible without scroll, font scale planned around image?
- [ ] **Hero top padding**: max `pt-24` at desktop, hero content does not float halfway down the viewport?
- [ ] **Hero stack discipline**: max 4 text elements in hero (eyebrow OR brand strip, headline, subtext, CTAs)? No tiny tagline below CTAs, no trust micro-strip in hero?
- [ ] **EYEBROW COUNT (mechanical)**: count instances of `uppercase tracking` micro-labels above section headlines across all components. Count ≤ ceil(sectionCount / 3)? Hero counts as 1.
- [ ] **Split-Header Ban**: no "left big headline + right small explainer paragraph" pattern as a section header (vertical stack instead)?
- [ ] **Zigzag Alternation Cap**: no 3+ consecutive sections with the same image+text-split layout?
- [ ] **No Duplicate CTA Intent**: no two CTAs with the same intent ("Get in touch" + "Let's talk" both on page = Fail)?
- [ ] **Logo wall = logo only**: no industry / category labels printed below logos?
- [ ] **Bento Background Diversity**: at least 2-3 bento cells have real visual variation (image, gradient, pattern), not all white-on-white text cards?
- [ ] **"Used by / Trusted by" logo wall** lives UNDER the hero, not inside it, uses REAL SVG logos (Simple Icons / devicon) or generated SVG marks, NOT plain text wordmarks?
- [ ] **Copy Self-Audit**: every visible string re-read, no grammatically-broken or AI-hallucinated phrases ("free on its past" type) shipped?
- [ ] **Motion motivated**: every animation can be justified in one sentence (hierarchy / storytelling / feedback / state transition), no GSAP-for-show?
- [ ] **Marquee max-one-per-page**: no two horizontal marquees on the same page?
- [ ] **Navigation on ONE line** at desktop, height ≤ 80px?
- [ ] **Section-Layout-Repetition** check: no two sections share the same layout family (at least 4 different families across 8 sections)?
- [ ] **Bento has rhythm AND exact cell count** (N items → N cells, no empty cells in middle or at end)?
- [ ] **Long lists use the right UI component** (not default `<ul>` with `divide-y` for > 5 items - see Section 4.9 alternatives)?
- [ ] **Real images used** (gen-tool first, then Picsum-seed, then explicit placeholder slots) - NO div-based fake screenshots, NO hand-rolled decorative SVGs, NO pure-text minimalism?
- [ ] **No pills/labels overlaid on images** (no `Plate · Brand`, no `Field notes - journal`)?
- [ ] **No photo-credit captions as decoration** (`Field study no. 12 · Ines Caetano`)?
- [ ] **No version footers** (`v1.4.2`, `Build 0048`) on marketing pages?
- [ ] **No micro-meta-sentences** under eyebrows ("Each of these is a feature we ship today...")?
- [ ] **No decoration text strip at hero bottom** (`BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.`)?
- [ ] **No floating top-right sub-text** in section headings?
- [ ] **No scoring/progress bars with filled background tracks** as comparison visuals?
- [ ] **No locale / city-name / time / weather strips** unless brief is genuinely globally-distributed or place-focused?
- [ ] **No scroll cues** (`Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`)?
- [ ] **No version labels in hero** (V0.6, BETA, INVITE-ONLY) unless the brief is a launch?
- [ ] **No section-numbering eyebrows** (`00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `06 · how it works`)?
- [ ] **No decorative dots** (zero by default, only for real semantic state)?
- [ ] **No `border-t` + `border-b` on every row** of long lists / spec tables?
- [ ] **Content density** sane: no 20-row data tables, no fake-precise specs without justification, ≤ 25-word sub-paragraphs by default?
- [ ] **Quotes ≤ 3 lines** of body, attribution clean (no em-dash)?
- [ ] **Motion claimed = motion shown**: if `MOTION_INTENSITY > 4`, page actually animates, not just claimed?
- [ ] **GSAP sticky-stack / horizontal-pan** implemented per Section 5.A / 5.B canonical skeleton (`start: "top top"`, `pin: true`, correct scrub)?
- [ ] **No `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - using Motion `useScroll()` / ScrollTrigger / IntersectionObserver / CSS scroll-driven animations only?
- [ ] **Reduced motion** wrapped for everything `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3`?
- [ ] **Dark mode** tokens defined and tested in both modes?
- [ ] **Mobile collapse** explicit (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) for high-variance layouts?
- [ ] **Viewport stability**: `min-h-[100dvh]`, never `h-screen`?
- [ ] **`useEffect` animations** have strict cleanup functions?
- [ ] **Empty / loading / error** states provided?
- [ ] **Cards omitted** in favor of spacing where possible?
- [ ] **Icons** from an allowed library only (Phosphor / HugeIcons / Radix / Tabler), no hand-rolled SVG paths?
- [ ] **Motion** isolated in client-leaf components with `'use client'` at the top, memoized?
- [ ] **No AI Tells** from Section 9 (Inter as default, AI-purple, three-equal cards, Jane Doe, Acme, "Quietly in use at")?
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** plausibly hit (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)?
- [ ] **One design system** per project (no Material + shadcn mixed)?
